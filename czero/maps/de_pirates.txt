Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing targets on this lovely island. 
Team members must defuse any bombs that 
threaten the targets.

Terrorists: Drunken and quarrelsome your
gang decided to get some rum out of Stan's
old distillery. So you should bomb the door
or destroy the fish market to fool the watch.

Other Notes: There are two targets
in this mission.
