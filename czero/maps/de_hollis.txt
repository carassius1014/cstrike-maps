The Terrorists have discovered the Counter-Terrorists secret vacation home in Hollis, NH!

After cracking open a cold one with the boys, the Counter-Terrorists got wind of the
impending attack and readied themselves on the back porch to mount a defense!

The Terrorists two main targets are a bedroom containing filing cabinets full of top
secret intel gathered on their activities and the kitchen which contains all of the
Counter-Terrorists beer, cider, and snacks.

The Counter-Terrorists must defend their intel, beer, cider, and snacks!
